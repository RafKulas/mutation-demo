# Mutation testing with Pitest (PIT)

**To begin with, the purpose of this project is NOT a theoretical introduction to mutation testing. I would more like to present the practical application of the [Pitest](https://pitest.org/) plugin (being more precisely, [Gradle version](https://gradle-pitest-plugin.solidsoft.info/) of it *#TeamGradle*) and what can be achieved with it.**
